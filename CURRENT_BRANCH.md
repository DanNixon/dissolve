# Current Branch Worklist

## Automatic Pair Potential
- Table of indicators showing if PP are OK, succesfully cross-generated, or are missing
  - Generate missing potentials automatically if functional form is the same and the PP allows it
  - Allow option to add missing potentials that can't be generated from a basic source (e.g. UFF?) 
- Store AtomType pointer in SpeciesAtom rather than global index?
