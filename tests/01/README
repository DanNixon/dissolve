Unit Test 01 - Forces test on 1000 water molecules
==================================================

Test of forces between 1000 equilibrated water molecules in a cubic box.
Reference forces are calculated with DL_POLY using LJ plus truncated
Coulomb, with cutoff distance of 15 Angstroms (truncation window width
is 2.0 Angstroms).
