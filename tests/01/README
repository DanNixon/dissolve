Unit Test 01 - Energy / forces test bulk water
==============================================

Test of forces between 1000 equilibrated water molecules in a cubic box.
Reference forces are calculated with DL_POLY using the SPC/FW forcefield.
Cutoff is 15.0 Angstroms in all cases.

Four test cases are considered:

1) Intramolecular Terms Only

Simulations with only bond and angle terms contributing to energy and forces.

2) van der Waals Terms Only

Simulations utilising only a Lennard-Jones potential contributing to energy and
forces, with charges and bond / angle force constants set to zero. The truncation
width is set to zero in this simulation in order to correctly reproduce the 
(non-truncated) LJ potential in DL_POLY.

3) Coulomb Terms Only

Simulations utilising only a Coulombic potential contributing to energy and
forces, with charges and bond / angle force constants set to zero. The truncation scheme
employed in DL_POLY is a more advanced form (Fennell and Gezelter) than that employed in
the present code (unmodified truncated and shifted potential) so energies and forces
are expected to contain slightly higher errors, and higher threshold values are used
for the corresponding tests.

4) Full Forcefield

Simulations employing full intramolecular and interatomic contributions to energy and
forces.
