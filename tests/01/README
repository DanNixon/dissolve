Unit Test 01 - Energy / forces test bulk water
==============================================

Test of forces between 1000 equilibrated water molecules in a cubic box.
Reference forces are calculated with DL_POLY using the SPC/FW forcefield.
Cutoff is 15.0 Angstroms in all cases.

Four test cases are considered:

1) Intramolecular Terms Only

Simulations with only bond and angle terms contributing to energy and forces.

2) van der Waals Terms Only

Simulations utilising only a Lennard-Jones potential contributing to energy and
forces, with charges and bond / angle force constants set to zero. The truncation
width is set to zero in this simulation in order to correctly reproduce the 
(non-truncated) LJ potential in DL_POLY.

At standard test threshold (0.1%) the test will fail because four atoms have very small
actual forces, so we are within absolute error:

 OW    796 - errors are  2.22825872e-03 ( 0.00%) -3.11711449e-04 ( 0.00%) -8.59981372e-03 (-3.18%) (x y z) 10J/mol
  DL_POLY forces are  1225.01868154           -1954.49704175               0.261973449973    

 OW   1657 - errors are  5.83142750e-03 (-0.00%)  2.51281376e-02 ( 0.01%) -1.09027552e-02 ( 1.62%) (x y z) 10J/mol
  DL_POLY forces are  -279.203352162            387.475509414             -0.685387813058    

 OW   2821 - errors are  2.02395125e-03 (-0.29%)  1.55921425e-03 ( 0.00%) -5.24764610e-03 ( 0.00%) (x y z) 10J/mol
  DL_POLY forces are    -0.690548847271       139.169178001             -931.130038220    

 OW   2860 - errors are  3.02940339e-03 (-0.00%)  3.55327456e-03 ( 0.11%)  5.55293368e-03 ( 0.00%) (x y z) 10J/mol

As such, the test is run with a relatively high threshold of 3.2%.

3) Coulomb Terms Only (truncated Coulomb sum)

Simulations utilising only a Coulombic potential contributing to energy and
forces, with charges and bond / angle force constants set to zero. The truncation scheme
employed in DL_POLY is a more advanced form (Fennell and Gezelter) than that employed in
the present code (unmodified truncated and shifted potential) and Coulomb terms are
calculated analytically in DL_POLY so energies and forces are expected to show slightly
higher errors, and higher threshold values are used for the corresponding tests.
If Coulomb terms are not included in the tabulated pair potentials, 

4) Coulomb Terms Only (direct Coulomb sum)

Simulations utilising only a Coulombic potential contributing to energy and
forces, with charges and bond / angle force constants set to zero. A direct Coulomb sum
is employed with no truncation scheme.

5) Full Forcefield

Simulations employing full intramolecular and interatomic contributions to energy and
forces. Coulomb terms are calculated employing the truncated and shifted form, so test
thresholds are adjusted to match.
