Unit Test 02 - Simulated S(Q) for water
=======================================

Comparison between calculated structure factors for water isotopologues and those from EPSR.

Notes:
EPSR input file set up to use all molecular origins in formation of g(r) (2000 for safety, since nmols is only 1000).
