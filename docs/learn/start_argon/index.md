# Liquid Argon (Step-by-Step)

15 minute read
{: .label .label-blue }

## Overview

We'll now set up a complete, simple simulation by hand to illustrate the basic usage of the GUI, and discuss a few topics in a bit more detail. Our target will be to describe liquid argon at 85 K, beginning from a set of reference interaction parameters, and then to refine this potential against some experimentally-measured data.

Steps:
- Create a species to represent an argon atom
- Add suitable interaction parameters
- Define a configuration consistent with experimentally-measured data
- Create processing layers to evolve the configuration, calculate suitable parmeters, and refine the interatomic potential

So, fire up the Dissolve GUI, choose _Create a New Simulation from Scratch_{: .text-green-100}, and we'll get started.
