## Summary

- Run, refine, and analyse the structure of liquid water at 298 K
- Three neutron datasets
  - Measured on SANDALS in 2001.
  - H<sub>2</sub>O: [SLS18498-H2O.mdcs01](https://github.com/trisyoungs/dissolve/tree/develop/examples/water/data/SLS18498-H2O.mdcs01)
  - HDO: [SLS18500-HDO5050.mdcs01](https://github.com/trisyoungs/dissolve/tree/develop/examples/water/data/SLS18500-HDO5050.mdcs01)
  - D<sub>2</sub>O: [SLS18502-D2O.mdcs01](https://github.com/trisyoungs/dissolve/tree/develop/examples/water/data/SLS18502-D2O.mdcs01)
- Reference input file: [water.txt](https://github.com/trisyoungs/dissolve/tree/develop/examples/water/water.txt)

XXX

Steps:
- Set up a suitable species and configuration
- Equilibrate the system
- Adjust intramolecular geometry to match experiment
- Refine the interatomic potentials
- Analyse the liquid structure of the refined simulation
