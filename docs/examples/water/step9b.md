### Define Atomic Sites

We'll need simple atomic sites for the oxygen and each of the hydrogen atoms in our water molecule, so let's create them now:

> **Water** species tab
{: .action .action_tabs}
> Open the **Analysis Sites** section
{: .step}
> Click-drag with the left mouse button in the species viewer and draw a box around the oxygen atom to select it
{: .action .action_mouse}
> Click the **Create** button in the viewer toolbar to create the new site (which will be called `O`)
{: .step}
> Repeat this for each hydrogen atom individually, naming those sites `H1` and `H2`
{: .step}
