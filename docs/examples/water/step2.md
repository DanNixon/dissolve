# Liquid Water

## 2. Set up a Configuration

From the _Configuration_{: .text-green-100} menu select _Create...â†’Simple random mix_{: .text-green-100} and choose your water species as the only component. The default density parameter (`rho`) defined in the generator for the configuration is 0.1 atoms/Angstrom**3, which just so happens to be the density for water at 298 K. All we need to adjust is the number of molecules in the system in the `AddSpecies` node for the water molecule. Change this to 1000, and then _Regenerate_{: .text-green-100} the configuration to get a box size of just over 31 Angstroms side length.

Finally - don't forget to change the _Temperature_{: .text-green-100} to 298 K.
