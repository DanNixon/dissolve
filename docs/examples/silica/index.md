# Bulk Silica

{: .label .label-blue }

## Summary

Amorphous silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) is found in a variety of places, and is a relatively simple, network forming glass. Here we'll set up a bulk silica simulation in a unit cell of our own design, and which can serve as the basis for other tutorials.

## Data Files
- Neutron data file: [SiO2_NIMROD.mint01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trisyoungs/dissolve/develop/examples/silica/data/SiO2_NIMROD.mint01)
- Reference input file: [sio2.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trisyoungs/dissolve/develop/examples/silica/sio2.txt)

## Preparation

Create a new directory in a suitable location and download or copy the data files listed above into it.

> Open the Dissolve GUI
{: .action .action_dissolve}
> Choose **Empty Simulation** from the _Create_ section
{: .step}
> Save As...
{: .action .action_menu}
> Save your input file under a sensible name in the directory containing the example data file
{: .step}
