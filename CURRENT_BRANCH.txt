# Current Branch Remit

## Prep
- Fix Analysis test case
- Spatial density function calculation
- 3D plotting of surfaces (marching cubes)

## Main
- Fix documentation (include path for mermaid)
- Convert argon example from quickstart guide.
- Add water example
- Add benzene example (inc. sdf/slicing comparison between equilibrated / refined simulations)
- Add silica example

## Post
- Convert quickstart guide to page in docs.
- Remove QuickstartGuide panel / wizard from UI? What other uses does it have?
- Remove Setup Wizard - prefer instead to have complete wizards for adding the necessary partial sections.
- Add System Templates to startup screen, which provide skeletal system setups for common (or not-so-common) use cases, but without any details of processing (which is the job of the Add Layer Wizard - contents of that could be called from the Templates wizard). For example: pure liquid, liquid mixture, A solvated in water, A+B solvated in water, silica, A confined in MCM-41, water, A+B confined in MCM-41.  Other examples, such as "A absorbed in MOF", need to ask for a cif file for the MOF, for instance. Store as individual, complete input files somewhere, which are somehow stored (in Qt resource, if we only care about accessing them via the GUI?). Can test these files, loading them as input to dissolve-serial, to check for consistency.
- Add description of purpose of CURRENT_BRANCH.txt file to developer docs.
